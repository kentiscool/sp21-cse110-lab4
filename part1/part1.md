1. 3, it prints out the last value of i which is the length of prices(3)
2. 150, it prints out the last discountedPrice which is 300/2
3. 150, it prints out the last finalPrice which is discountedPrice which is 300/2
4. [50, 100, 150], the for loop creates an array based on the old prices and gets (1 - discount) of each of them
5. Error: i was not defined, because it was instantiated with let within the for loop.
6. 150, despite being defined with let; the console log was executed in the same scope
7. 150, despite being defined with let; the console log was executed in the same scope
8. Same as 4
9. Error: i was not defined, because it was instantiated with let within the for loop.
10. 3, it just prints out the length of prices
